ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Alejandro-Orellana.

I'm building AI retrieval systems (among many things), the latest of which automates financial analysisâ€”because it brings together everything I love: numbers, uncertainty, the written word, and discovery. I've always been drawn to things that make sense of complexity.

Years ago (c 2014-2018), I helped scale a "Moneyball"-style system to rank the performance of public company executives. This experience introduced me to semantic search algorithms, which seem basic by today's standards but were deeply formative.

My career began at Morgan Stanley, where I enjoyed finance until I realized that the future would be shaped by those who create software, not just those who use it.

My journey with technology started as a boy in El Salvador. We couldn't afford a computer, but my dad collected floppy disks, insisting they'd become important someday. I still don't know how he knew, but his belief ignited something in meâ€”a conviction that technology could open doors, even when life felt closed off.

I love building products for others; it's the purest form of problem-solving. Everything I learn, I dream of passing along to my daughter, hoping she'll build bigger and better things than I ever could.

Outside of work, I run, lift weights, and explore the world with my wife and daughter. Years ago, I found peace in painting; today, that same creative energy drives my work.

PS
Here you'll find projects focused on generative AI, retrieval systems, and practical solutions I've developed to navigate complexity, sometimes in their draft form before implementing at scale ðŸ˜ƒ.
