👋 Hi, I'm @Alejandro-Orellana.

👨🏻‍💻 I love synthesizing complexity into structured, actionable technology solutions across multiple domains like scalable AWS architectures and GenAI-powered platforms to solve meaningful challenges.

🚀 Driven by pragmatism and precision, I thrive on aligning cross-functional teams and complex integrated systems to deliver tangible results at scale.
